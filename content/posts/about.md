Writer, speaker, & gamifier. The higher ed version of a Broadway triple threat.

Think of me as a bridge -- I explain computers to people and people to computers. 

My passions focus on customer service, customer experience, system design, game-based learning, and helping parents connect with their kids through modern tabletop games.

I also organize the Fort Wayne "elf hub" for IC3D's national 3D printed Toys for Tots campaign. In 2024, my team's elves printed and donated over 2,500 toys that supported Columbia City's Toys for Tots program, the Iris Family Support Center (formerly SCAN), and other local non-profits. (If you have a 3D printer and want to make toys to donate, send me a message!)
